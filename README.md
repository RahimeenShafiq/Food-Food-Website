🚀 **FoodFood - A Foodpanda-Style Frontend Project** 🍔🍕  

FoodFood is a simple yet stylish food delivery website built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. As a beginner, I wanted to challenge myself by implementing what I’ve learned so far, focusing on responsive design, navigation, and UI components. 

This project was created as a personal exercise in web development and is intended to serve as a portfolio piece.
